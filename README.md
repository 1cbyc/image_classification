# trying to build a method to identify diseases by the way they look in xrays

1. going about this project, first thing i did was setup my env using `source venv/bin/activate` 
2. once my env is setup, i installed the requirements i decided on earlier `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. since all that is done, i setup the method to commit my progress as it comes
4. then i mapped the directory for the project so i will start creating the subfolders for the project
5. having done that, i want to use an existing medical imaging dataset i found on kaggle. so let me use the pneumonia detection dataset first.
